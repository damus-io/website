<h1 id="v0.1.4---ok-can-you-guys-stop-developing">v0.1.4 - Ok can you
guys stop developing</h1>
<p>So someone had the smart idea[1] to create nostr chatrooms, so
naturally damus should support these. I know I said the previous release
would be the last release before lightning support, but chatrooms are
pretty cool and I wanted to squeeze in an initial chatroom release. So
here we are.</p>
<p>I haven’t added full chatroom support yet, like searching for and
joining channels. The way that this release currently works is that if
you see one of your friends chatting in a chatroom, you’ll be able to
reply to that chat from your home feed, or pop into the chatroom by
clicking on the post.</p>
<p>In the future I plan on having full chatroom support, probably
something like how telegram displays their chatrooms.</p>
<p>It’s up on testflight now so check it out!</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
