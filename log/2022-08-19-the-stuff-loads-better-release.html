<h1 id="v0.1.3---the-stuff-loads-better-release">v0.1.3 - The “Stuff
Loads Better” Release</h1>
<p>It’s that time again! A new damus release. This one fixes a bunch of
annoying issues such as profiles not loading properly in some
situations. We also do a much better job at caching profile pictures, so
no more weird poppyness and wasting your cell data.</p>
<p>If you’re not on the testflight already, you can get it here:</p>
